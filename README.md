# Q-learning
A model free reinforcement learning algorithm for detect and defense task in a smart power system
# Description
For each possible observation-action pair (o; a), we propose to learn a Q(o; a) value, i.e., the expected future cost, using an RL algorithm where all Q(o; a) values are stored in a Q-table. After learning the Q-table, the policy of the defender will be choosing the action a with the minimum Q(o; a) for each observation o.
